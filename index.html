    <h1>Lama Abdullah</h1>
 <p>My name is Lama Abdullah. I'm a fresh graduate, holding a bachelor's degree in computer science with first-class honours.
    I have worked on many projects as a front-end web developer 
    and Cisco, through which I gained experience.
  but I aspire to learn more in this field and develop my skills.  That's why I chose to attend the Web Application Development Camp using JavaScript.
